# React-Store
A online store created with React. Just a model to showcase the react workflow. Styling is done through styled components, css and bootstrap.
 
Data is not dynamic and cannot be updated automatically but you can add products by yourself in data.js file. 
Also payment option is available using paypal checkout option.
paypal installation link:-
> paypal install https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-paypal-express-checkout

before running the app make sure you create a .dev.environment file and place your paypal key there like so:
`REACT_APP_APP_ID = "YOUR APP ID"` to make your paypal work.

also install all dependecies by `npm install` and run server `npm start`

Screenshots provided soon :)
